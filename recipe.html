        <h2 style="color: peru ;"><b><u>The History of Pasta</u> </b></h2>
Pasta’s history can be traced through many cultures and continents, from Asia to Africa to the Middle East, reaching back at least 3500 years. Despite its many forms and the countless texts in which it has appeared, pasta seems to be universally associated with Italy. According to history, however, pasta’s earliest roots begin in China, during the Shang Dynasty (1700-1100 BC), where some form of pasta was made with either wheat or rice flour. Pasta also appears to be a feature in the ancient Greek diet in the first millennium BC. Likewise, Africa had its own form of pasta made with the kamut crop. <br>

As early as the fourth century BC, the story of pasta takes shape in Italy. There is archeological evidence for the existence of pasta in the Etruscan civilization, which flourished in the regions we now call Lazio, Umbria and Tuscany. A bas-relief unearthed in an Etruscan tomb depicts tools and kitchen utensils used to roll and form pasta very similar to those still in use today. A lucky find for anthropology, but a sad blow to the legend of Marco Polo, which claims he was the one who introduced pasta to Europe after his adventures in the Far East. He may have brought some unusual noodles back with him, but it was certainly not the first time Italians had ever seen such food. <br>

          <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);">Step 1: Boil Water</b> <br>
            Start with a very large pot of water, about 6 quarts per pound of pasta. Bring it to a rapid boil. Tip: A pound of pasta feeds about 5 to 6 people.
            <br></li> 

            <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);">Step 2: Add Salt</b> <br>
            Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons. If you taste the water, it should taste like the sea.
            
            <br></li>
            
           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);">Step 2: Add Salt</b> <br>
            Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons. If you taste the water, it should taste like the sea.
            
            <br></li>
            
           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);">  Step 4: Stir</b> <br>
            Stir it occasionally while it cooks. Use the cooking time on the pasta package as a guide.
            <br></li>

           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);"> Step 5: Taste the Pasta</b> <br>
            But watch out — it's hot! Sample the pasta at about 2 minutes shy of the indicated time. It should be al dente. You'll finish cooking it in the sauce. Tip: "Al dente" means "to the tooth," meaning the pasta should still have a little bite to it.
            <br></li>

           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);"> Step 6: Drain</b> <br>
            Drain the pasta. Just be sure to save about 1 cup of the pasta water. If you have a pot with a colander insert, use it to drain the pasta. If not, drain the pasta in a colander set in the sink.
            <br></li>
            
           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);"> Step 7: Removing Ravioli</b> <br>
            If you're cooking ravioli, use a slotted skimmer and gently lift the ravioli a few at a time.
            <br></li>
            
           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);"> Step 8: Stir in the Sauce</b> <br>
            Add the pasta to your sauce and finish cooking it in the sauce. Give it a stir to coat. <br></li>
            
            
           <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);"> Step 9: Add Pasta Water</b> <br>
            Ladle a few tablespoons of the pasta water at a time until you have the right consistency to your sauce. Remember, the pasta will absorb the liquid. Tip: Pasta water helps to thicken the sauce.
            <br></li>
          <li><b  style="color: rgb(214, 122, 127);">  Step 9: Add Pasta Water</b> <br>
            Simmer over medium-low heat — it'll help the pasta soak up the sauce. Follow your recipe's instructions for finishing the dish. And that's all there is to it.</p> <br></li>
